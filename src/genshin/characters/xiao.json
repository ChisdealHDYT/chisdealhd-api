    "description": "One of the 'Mighty and Illuminated Adepti' guarding Liyue, also heralded as the 'Guardian Yaksha.' Despite his appearance as a young man, occasional legends about him have been documented in ancient books. He is especially fond of Wangshu Inn's Almond Tofu. The reason is that the dish tastes just like the 'dreams' he used to devour.",
